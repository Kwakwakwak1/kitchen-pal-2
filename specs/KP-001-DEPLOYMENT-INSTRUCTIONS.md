# KP-001 Recipe Import Fix - Deployment Instructions

## Quick Deployment (Production)

You now have a complete production solution for the recipe import functionality! Here's how to deploy it:

### 1. Build and Deploy Enhanced Docker Setup

```bash
# Build all services including the new recipe-proxy
npm run docker:build

# Start all services (app + recipe-proxy + nginx + postgres + cloudflare tunnel)
npm run docker:up

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Verify Services are Running

```bash
# Check that all services are healthy
docker-compose ps

# You should see:
# - kitchen-pal-app: Up (healthy)
# - kitchen-pal-proxy: Up (healthy)  ← NEW!
# - kitchen-pal-nginx: Up (healthy)
# - kitchen-pal-db: Up (healthy)
# - kitchen-pal-tunnel: Up
```

### 3. Test the Recipe Import Fix

1. **Go to your deployed app**: https://kitchen-pal.kwakwakwak.com/
2. **Navigate to Recipe Import** (Add Recipe → Import from URL)
3. **Test with the Delish URL that was failing**:
   ```
   https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a63570903/copycat-chilis-nashville-hot-mozzarella-sticks-recipe/
   ```

### 4. Expected Behavior

✅ **Before (Failing)**:
- All public CORS proxies failing
- "Failed to fetch URL with all proxies" error
- Network tab showing failed requests

✅ **After (Fixed)**:
- Production proxy at `/recipe-proxy` works first
- Recipe successfully imported with all details
- Better error messages if fallbacks are needed

## What We've Added

### New Production Components

1. **`recipe-proxy` Docker Service**
   - Runs the enhanced local proxy server in production
   - Available at `http://recipe-proxy:3001` internally
   - Exposed publicly via nginx at `/recipe-proxy`

2. **Enhanced Nginx Configuration**
   - Routes `/recipe-proxy` to the proxy service
   - Proper headers and timeouts
   - Rate limiting (5 requests/burst)

3. **Smart Proxy Detection**
   - Production: Uses `https://kitchen-pal.kwakwakwak.com/recipe-proxy`
   - Development: Uses `http://localhost:3001/recipe-proxy`
   - Falls back to public proxies if needed

### Enhanced Error Handling

- **User-friendly error messages** instead of technical jargon
- **Timeout handling** (20-second limit)
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Detailed logging** for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### If Recipe Import Still Fails

1. **Check proxy service status**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs recipe-proxy
   ```

2. **Test proxy directly**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://kitchen-pal.kwakwakwak.com/recipe-proxy?url=https%3A//www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a63570903/copycat-chilis-nashville-hot-mozzarella-sticks-recipe/"
   ```

3. **Check nginx routing**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs nginx
   ```

### Rollback if Needed

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Remove the recipe-proxy service from docker-compose.yml
# Remove the nginx /recipe-proxy location blocks

# Restart without proxy service
docker-compose up -d
```

## Success Metrics

After deployment, you should see:

- ✅ Recipe imports working from Delish, AllRecipes, Food Network
- ✅ Better error messages when sites are unavailable
- ✅ Faster response times (production proxy is prioritized)
- ✅ Improved reliability with fallback chain

The production proxy service ensures that your deployed app has the same reliable recipe import functionality as your local development environment!
