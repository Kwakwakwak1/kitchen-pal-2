## Specification ID
KP-001-Import-Recipe-URL-Scraping-Fix

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Implementation finished and tested successfully in both Chrome and Safari

## Overview
Fix the recipe URL import functionality that was failing with "Failed to fetch URL with all proxies" errors when attempting to scrape recipes from cooking websites, with specific Safari compatibility issues.

**RESOLUTION**: Fixed critical infrastructure and compatibility issues to ensure cross-browser recipe import functionality. The solution addresses Docker networking, browser-specific response parsing, and CORS handling to provide reliable recipe import across all major browsers.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Successfully import recipes from popular cooking websites (Delish, AllRecipes, Food Network, etc.)
2. Handle CORS restrictions properly
3. Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages
4. Provide fallback mechanisms when direct scraping fails
5. Display loading states during import process

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement proper proxy rotation or alternative scraping methods
2. Handle rate limiting from target websites
3. Parse recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions, images) accurately
4. Validate URL format before attempting import
5. Implement timeout handling for slow responses

## Implementation Details

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cloudflare Tunnel Connectivity**: Tunnel was configured to use `localhost:80` which resolved to IPv6, causing connection failures to the nginx service
2. **Safari Response Parsing**: Production proxy responses were not being parsed correctly due to URL pattern mismatch in client-side JavaScript
3. **CORS Preflight Handling**: Safari requires proper OPTIONS request handling for cross-origin requests
4. **Browser Compatibility**: AbortSignal.timeout() is not supported in older Safari versions

### Changes Implemented

1. **Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration** (`cloudflare/config.yml`)
   - ✅ Changed service URL from `http://localhost:80` to `http://nginx:80`
   - ✅ Ensures proper Docker service networking instead of IPv6 localhost resolution

2. **Safari Response Parsing** (`services/recipeScrapingService.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated proxy detection logic to handle both development (`localhost:3001`) and production (`/recipe-proxy`) endpoints
   - ✅ Ensures Safari properly parses JSON responses from production proxy
   - ✅ Replaced `AbortSignal.timeout()` with Safari-compatible `AbortController` pattern

3. **CORS Preflight Support** (`nginx/nginx.conf`)
   - ✅ Added proper OPTIONS request handling for Safari compatibility
   - ✅ Enhanced CORS headers for preflight requests
   - ✅ Configured proper response codes and headers for cross-origin requests

4. **Production Proxy Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Docker containerized proxy service with proper networking
   - ✅ Enhanced retry logic and user-agent rotation
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling and timeout management

### Critical Fix Points
- **Docker Networking**: Always use service names (`nginx`, `recipe-proxy`) instead of `localhost` in container configurations
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use `AbortController` instead of `AbortSignal.timeout()` for Safari support
- **Response Parsing**: Ensure client-side logic handles both development and production proxy URL patterns
- **CORS Handling**: Implement proper OPTIONS preflight handling for Safari's strict CORS enforcement

## Testing Results
✅ **Successfully Tested**:
1. **Cross-browser compatibility**: Verified recipe import works in both Chrome and Safari
2. **Production deployment**: Confirmed functionality on live environment (https://kitchen-pal.kwakwakwak.com/)
3. **Delish.com integration**: Successfully imports recipes from previously failing URLs
4. **Proxy infrastructure**: Verified production proxy service handles requests reliably
5. **Error handling**: Confirmed proper fallback behavior and user-friendly error messages

✅ **Validation Completed**:
- Docker container networking and service communication
- Cloudflare tunnel connectivity and routing
- CORS preflight handling for Safari
- Response parsing for both development and production environments

## Deployment Notes
✅ **Completed Successfully**:
- Updated Cloudflare tunnel configuration requires service restart
- Safari compatibility changes deployed to production
- No environment variable changes required
- All changes are backward compatible

## Prevention Guidelines
To avoid similar issues in future deployments:

1. **Docker Networking**: Always use Docker service names instead of `localhost` in container configurations
2. **Browser Testing**: Test all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) during development
3. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure proper OPTIONS handling for all proxy endpoints
4. **Response Parsing**: Verify client-side logic handles all proxy URL patterns (dev and prod)
5. **Timeout Handling**: Use cross-browser compatible patterns like `AbortController`

## Monitoring
- Recipe import success rates across browsers
- Proxy service health and response times
- Error logging for failed recipe imports
- User feedback on import functionality
