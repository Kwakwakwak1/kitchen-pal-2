Let's say in the future you decide to go get a recipe from another website and then you run into these issues. Again, I need to be able to get notification or see what website you are trying to import. So then I can update the cores to allow for that website to be properly scraped. So it will be like an ongoing scraper tool that gets built incrementally to work with sites that we are adding.

I want to implement the rating but ratings per let's say I want to rate this particular recipe the Caribbean red peas soup I want to rate it at three I want to be able to see all of the ratings but also let's say Taylor creates an account and she has recipes in there or I have recipes Taylor has recipes we're both in a family and so we have access to each other's recipes and each other's ratings on the recipes so Taylor gives it a three I give it a four then we have the combined rating of three point five or yeah three point five if if I select and then the other thing that I was talking to Taylor about yesterday was the ability to let's say we know Junie's gonna be out or I know you're gonna go out on vacation somewhere and Junie and I I want to feed he likes mushrooms so we make something and we use the optional version we add mushrooms and we do this particular piece to where now I can opt out and even though Junie's in the family Taylor's in the family and I'm in the family we can select meals that are good for just me and Junie higher rating meals for between me and Junie what did we rate high so like later on if Junie's like oh I really like chicken nuggets and something you know if I'm just watching him I can look up and say okay cool what is what are I can be select myself and just select Taylor or select Junie and just see what are their highest rating recipes from the recipes that we have shared if they have it if they've rated any of them so that's kind of another thing that I wanted to do is to have people in the family be able to share your recipes with people and in your family but also share it publicly about having that rating system as well is going to be important for that

I've got to fix the bug in how the instructions are formatted on that detailed page for the recipe. Because it's all just one paragraph and I think I want to split it up into steps or something. Maybe I go a little bit deeper into the parsing of the recipes and identifying the breaks in between the steps. That's something that I want to work on.

Yeah, with the pictures being the avocado and it's just the default image if you have imported a recipe which means that if you go into the edit recipe and you look you can see that that form that pops up at The bottom it shows the source URL If the recipe has a source URL because I'm also saving that any existing recipes I'm gonna try to create some sort of script or something to Update the image with the image from the website So then that image can be generated for that particular meal without you having to Reimport from that website if that makes sense, especially if you change things and specify certain items

For the tool tips or modals that show up for the tagged ingredients inside of the instructions, we need to provide the different measuring amounts. So if it's .67 cups, it could be whatever in milliliters, whatever in tablespoons, just provide all of the measurements in this tool tip.
